**Some things about me:**

- I'm currently doing research + creating something new at [OpenAI](https://x.com/OpenAI).
- Before this, I spent a year doing [deep dives](/deep-dives) in residence at [Bain Capital Ventures](https://baincapitalventures.com/) and realizing what I want to make of my life, 3 years as a founding engineer at [thirdweb](https://x.com/thirdweb), and 2 years studying computer science and neuroscience at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) [now on leave].
- I love creating [writing, software, startups]. Startups are special because they let you create beautiful things for the world at scale.
- I see art as the product of any creative process with constraints. I view startups as the art form of capitalism, and life as the ultimate art form.
- My personal philosophy has changed drastically over the past decade. My [current world view](/writing/who-are-you-really) is a synthesis of ideas from [non-dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism), [Kashmir Shaivism](/reading/tantra-illuminated), [Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta), Buddhism, and Christianity.

**Some things I'm interested in:**

- Neuroscience and neurotech. They combine many of my biggest interests: computation, intelligence, consciousness, and philosophy.
- Education, especially in early development [ages 0-14] where many critical behaviors are solidifed. I will work on this in the future.
- Health and fitness. I like optimizing for athleticism as the balance between aesthetics and functionality.
- I like learning new things, especially from people who see beauty in their subject. I am interested in learning about everything important to anything [with priority on the highest leverage ideas].
- I like beautiful art of all forms [anime, visual arts, music, games].
