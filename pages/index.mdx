**Some things about me:**

- I’m currently running a content agency, [The Ease Media](https://x.com/TheEaseMedia), where we work with top YouTube creators to create content that resonates at scale.
- Before this, I spent years exploring and experimenting — building a modest reselling business, creating on YouTube, playing esports, and trying other small ventures that taught me how to make things (and money) from scratch.
- I’ve also spent time studying history, philosophy, storytelling, and artificial intelligence deeply out of a fascination.
- I love creating [software, businesses, films].
- My personal philosophy has evolved drastically over the past few years. My current worldview is a synthesis of ideas from Nietzsche, Osho, Russell, and Nehru with a deep respect for non-dualism and Indian philosophical traditions.

**Some things I'm interested in:**

- History and philosophy. They help me see patterns in the past and imagine the future with clarity.
- Business, marketing, AI, and science.
- Filmmaking. I’m fascinated by cinematography, set design, and the craft of building immersive worlds through stories. Making a film or short film is something I plan to pursue.
- I enjoy learning new things, especially from people who see beauty in their subject. I’m interested in learning about everything important to anything [with priority on the highest leverage ideas].
- I like beautiful art of all forms [visual arts, music, games...].
